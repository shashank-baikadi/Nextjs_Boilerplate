## Presentation Layer
Purpose:
The presentation layer handles the UI and API routes. It interacts with the application layer to perform operations and present results to the user.

Components:

Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and responses.
Pages/Components: UI components in Next.js.
Why:

Separates UI concerns from business logic.
Provides a clean way to handle user interactions and API endpoints.
